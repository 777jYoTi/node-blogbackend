        title:'ELBOW PLANK',
        para:'Plank pose is most commonly used as a transitional pose, moving the body from high to lower planes, and vice versa. It is used within the sun salutation (surya namaskara) sequences and vinyasa sequences, as the yogi steps back to plank and lowers into chatturanga. Plank pose is also known as a pose in its own right, and is often held for long periods of time to build strength, heat, and energy in the body. Because plank pose requires a certain extent of strength and endurance, it is an ideal pose to refocus and re-energize, and overcome from sluggish energy or ‘stuck’ emotions.'

// about : "Yoga is an ancient spiritual practice rooted in India. As a fitness strategy, it blends physical poses (asanas) with breathing techniques(pranayama). Because it has some elements of mindfulness, yoga is sometimes called meditative movement. It is popular in the United States. A 2017 survey showed that one in seven adults had practiced it during the preceding year. About 94% of those who do yoga say they do it to improve their overall wellness. Pilates is also a valuable tool for physical rehabilitation. In one review of 23 studies, 17 studies found that Pilates reduced pain and disability in individuals with a variety of conditions, including back pain, neck pain, scoliosis, and multiple sclerosis. Pilates is not an aerobic exercise. But it can reduce stress, which does benefit the heart.",
